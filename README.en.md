go-doudou(doudou pronounced doudou/dəudəu/)is a golang decentralized microservice agile development framework 
based on the gossip protocol for service registration and discovery,openapi3.0 specification for interface definition.  
go-doudou uses a set of command line tools to help developers quickly initialize one or a set of RESTful services.
Designing a set of apis by defining methods in the interface type,
then generating the main function to run your service,router and corresponding handler,client go code through command line tools.  
go-doudou advocates design first,by pre-designing and definition interfaces to generate code.
After modifying the definition,recovering or incrementally generating code to achieve rapid development.  
go-doudou canonizes the spirit of contract,statement the interface,regulates the cooperation between service providers and consumers,
and prompts the whole develop team to improve delivery efficiency through openapi3.0 protocol.
